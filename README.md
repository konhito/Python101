# Python Learning Journey - Code Snippets



Welcome to my Python Learning Journey! This repository is a collection of code snippets that I learn and practice every day as a Python newbie. It's a record of my progress and growth as I explore the exciting world of Python programming.

## Introduction

As a beginner in Python, I am enthusiastic about mastering the language and honing my programming skills. This repository serves as a personal diary of my Python journey, where I upload new code snippets regularly. Each code snippet represents a concept or technique that I have learned during my daily studies.

## Contents

The repository is structured in a simple manner. Each code snippet is placed in a separate file and stored in the "code_snippets" folder. The filenames are named descriptively to indicate the topic or concept covered in the snippet.


## Usage

Feel free to explore the code snippets in this repository to learn along with me. Each snippet is short, focused, and accompanied by comments to explain the code's purpose and functionality. You can run the snippets individually to see the output and understand how they work.

To run the code snippets:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone` or download it as a ZIP file and extract it.
2. Navigate to the "code_snippets" folder.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and run the Python files using the command `python filename.py`. For example, to run the "hello_world.py" snippet, use `python hello_world.py`.

## Contribution

As a beginner, I am open to feedback, suggestions, and improvements. If you spot any issues with the code snippets or have suggestions for better approaches, please feel free to create an issue or submit a pull request. I am eager to learn from experienced developers and grow as a Python programmer.

## Resources

Throughout my learning journey, I rely on various resources to expand my knowledge of Python. Some of the resources I find helpful include:

- Online tutorials from websites like Codecademy, Real Python, and Python.org.
- YouTube tutorials from channels like Corey Schafer, Sentdex, and Tech With Tim.
- Python books for beginners, such as "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" and "Python Crash Course."

## Connect

I believe in learning together and supporting each other on this journey. If you are also learning Python or have any questions, feel free to connect with me on social media or via email. Let's inspire and motivate each other to become proficient Python developers!
